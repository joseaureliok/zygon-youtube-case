-- | LYRICS |--

The club isn’t the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow
you come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I’ll give it a chance now
Take my hand stop, put van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance
And now I’m singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don’t mind me 
Say boy let’s not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with your body

Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 

One week in we let the story begin
We’re going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat 
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family’s doing ok
leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
and I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead 
I may be crazy, don’t mind me
Say boy let’s not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I’m in love with your body
Oh I x 4 
I’m in love with your body
Oh I x 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 

Come on be my baby come on X 8

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I’m in love with your body
Come on be my baby come on X 6
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you

Lyrics: 
From the first time I felt the click in my heart
I keep running, oh I keep running away
Try to sleep but the aching tears me apart
I keep running, oh I keep running away
Oh am I wasting the day?
I keep running, oh I keep running away
Oh does it hurt me to stay?
I keep running, oh cus I don't wanna pay
Stars shine but start to fade in the light
Love is blind, could be wrong or it could be right
In a bind telling myself it's for you
For you…
Running and running
Running and running
Running and running hey hey hey hey
For you…
Running and running
Running and running
Running and running hey hey
In the night the devil knocks on my door
I keep running, oh I keep running away
Another life and the same thing happened before
Oh and he begs me to stay
I keep running, oh I keep running away
Oh will he take me away?
I keep running, oh cus I don't wanna pay
Stars shine but start to fade in the light
Love is blind, could be wrong or it could be right
In a bind telling myself it's for you
For you…
running and running
Running and running
Running and running hey hey hey hey
For you…
running and running
Running and running
Running and running hey hey

Lyrics:

You know what they say
About men like you,
Working night and day,
Like you always do.

Do you really wanna play?
Cuz I don't follow rules,
And I ain't got taboos.

You're such a smooth operator,
Straight out Goodfellas,
Your feelings come and go.

The one and only Heartbreaker,
You're on my radar,
Your feelings come and go.

They come and go,
They come and go.

You're such a smooth operator,
Straight out Goodfellas,
Your feelings come and go.

The one and only Heartbreaker,
You're on my radar,
Your feelings come and go.

You're playing with my mind,
And I can't explain,
I'm losing track of time,
Keep driving me insane.

But I wanna play it hard,
Cuz  I'm good at your games,
See if I can be tamed.

You're such a smooth operator,
Straight out Goodfellas,
Your feelings come and go.

The one and only Heartbreaker,
You're on my radar,
Your feelings come and go.

They come and go,
They come and go.

You're such a smooth operator,
Straight out Goodfellas,
Your feelings come and go.

The one and only Heartbreaker,
You're on my radar,
Your feelings come and go.",292,157155,35,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FzDfcYDMINc/default.jpg,12:00:21,26/01/2024

Lyrics:
We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can’t be sold 
We were right til we weren’t
Built a home and watched it burn 
 
I didn’t wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna lie
Started to cry but then remembered I
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah I can love me better than you can
 
I can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
 
Paint my nails, cherry red 
Match the roses that you left 
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said 
 
I didn’t wanna wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna fight 
Started to cry but then remembered I 
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing 
And I can hold my own hand 
Yeah I can love me better than you can 
 
I can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I
 
I didn’t wanna wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna fight 
Started to cry but then remembered I 
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing 
And I can hold my own hand 
Yeah I can love me better than
Yeah I can love me better than you can
 
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better

Can love me better

Lyrics:
I'm spending my summertime
Half the time crying again
Had the blues over you
I didn't hang with my friends
You fake cry, that's a lie
Tell me was it all pretend?
In my head, in my head

You're needing all the time again
Our time again
Needing the time again
Our time again
Wasting our time again
Our time again
We don't have nothing to say
So we have nothing left

La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

I wasted like half of my summer tryna hold on your hand
You're the leech, I'm the man
I guess you don't understand
Holding hands, say I can't
You're telling me yes I can
Yes I can, yes I can
I wasted like half of my summer tryna hold on your hand
You're the leech, I'm the man
I guess you don't understand
Holding hands, say I can't
You're telling me yes I can

Lyrics:
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sit quietly
Agree politely
 
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything
 
(Pre-Chorus)
You held me down but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
 
You held me down but I got up
Get ready ’cause I’ve had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 
(Chorus)
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
‘Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar
 
Louder, louder than a lion
‘Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
 
Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero
To my own hero
 
(Pre-Chorus)
You held me down but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
 
You held me down but I got up
Get ready ’cause I’ve had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 
(Chorus)
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
‘Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar

Lyrics: Sorry – Justin Bieber
 
You gotta go and get 
Angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies 
I hope I don't run out of Time could someone call the referee
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness 
 
I know you know that I 
made those mistakes maybe once or twice 
And by once or twice I Mean 
Maybe a couple a hundred times 
So let me oh let me 
Redeem oh redeem oh my self tonight 
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances 
 
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
I’m sorry yeah
Sorry yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I’m sorry now
 
I'll take every single piece of the blame 
If you want me too 
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go I'll go and then 
You go you go out and spill the truth 
Can we both say the words and forget this 
 
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I’m sorry (yeah)
Sorry (oh)
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I’m sorry (yeah)
Sorry (oh)
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now

LYRICS
When you’re out in church singing gloria
I’m on the floor in euphoria
Tears in my eyes, out of my mind
Bury my pain deeper inside

If the devil comes along, gets a hold of ya
Hurry up and hide in euphoria
I’ll meet you there keep you company
But don’t take no advice if it comes from me

GLORIA
EUPHORIA

Living life like a cheap James dean
Watching myself through a movie screen yeah 
Where did all the time go
Wasted every minute tryna balance on a tightrope

Prayed for an Angel and she came to me
Had a face like it’s straight from a magazine yeah

But i had to mess that up too
Cos I push away everything 
I really should hold on to

And I wonder how
I’m lonely now

When you’re out in church singing gloria [GLORIA]
I’m on the floor in euphoria [EUPHORIA]
Tears in my eyes, out of my mind
Bury my pain deeper inside

If the devil comes along, gets a hold of ya [HOLD OF YA]
Hurry up and hide in euphoria [EUPHORIA]
I’ll meet you there keep you company
But don’t take no advice if it comes from me

GLORIA
EUPHORIA
I’ll meet you there keep you company
But don’t take no advice if it comes from me

Feeling lower than I’ve ever been
Filling these cracks with my medicine yeah
You use to take care of me
Now I’m spending all my money getting over you in therapy 

Cos my memories lie
I’m compromised
I remember it so differently 
How’d we go from friends
To lovers to enemies

And I wonder how
I’m lonely now

When you’re out in church singing gloria [GLORIA]
I’m on the floor in euphoria [EUPHORIA]
Tears in my eyes, out of my mind
Bury my pain deeper inside

If the devil comes along, gets a hold of ya [HOLD OF YA]
Hurry up and hide in euphoria [EUPHORIA]
I’ll meet you there keep you company
But don’t take no advice if it comes from me

GLORIA
EUPHORIA
I’ll meet you there keep you company
But don’t take no advice if it comes from me

If it comes from me yeah
If it comes from me yeah
If it comes from me 

I’ll meet you there keep you company
But don’t take no advice if it comes
If it comes from me
If it comes from me
I’ll meet you there keep you company
But don’t take no advice if it comes from me

Lyrics:
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
‘Cause I am capable of anything
Of anything and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don’t make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you’re fallin’ for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‘Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‘Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Don’t walk away
It’s in the palm of your hand now, baby
It’s a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure
Before you give it all to me
All to me
Give it all to me

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you’re fallin’ for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‘Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‘Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

(Juicy J)
She’s a beast
I call her Karma
She’ll eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty heart is on steroids
‘Cause her love is so strong

You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She’s sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She’ll turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I’m gon’ put her in a coma

Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad, sprung and I don’t care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair

Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil’ mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you’re fallin’ for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‘Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‘Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

Lyrics
Holding me back,
Gravity’s holding me back,
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand,
Why don’t we leave it at that?,
Nothing to say,
When everything gets in the way,
Seems you cannot be replaced,
And I’m the one who will stay,
Ooh,
 
In this world,
It’s just us,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
In this world,
It’s just us,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
As it was,
As it was,
You know it’s not the same,
 
Answer the phone,
“Harry, you’re no good alone,
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?,
What kind of pills are you on?”,
Ringing the bell,
And nobody’s coming to help,
Your daddy lives by himself,
He just wants to know that you’re well,
Ooh,
 
In this world,
It’s just us,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
In this world,
It’s just us,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
As it was,
As it was,
You know it’s not the same,
 
Go home,
Get ahead, 
Light speed internet,
I don’t want to talk about the way that it was,
Leave America, 
Two kids follow her,
I don’t want to talk about who’s doing it first,
(Hey!),
 
As it was,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
As it was,
As it was,

""Let Her Go"" [Lyrics]

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much
And you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go
And you let her go
Well you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Lyrics:

I think I knew right off the bat
One hit, I'm feeling different
From early morning to the sunset
Eyes on you like I've got tunnel vision

Hold my breath
We diving off the deep end
Pull me closer tell me what you thinking
Supernatural magic when you speaking
You got me out of my head

How'd you make the time stop
oooooo
Whenever you're around my head is in the clouds
You're dancing in your white socks
oooooo
Now I can slow it down
I wanna scream it out
You got me like
oooooo
I think I'm so in love with you
How'd you make the time stop
oooooo

I thought that we should just be friends
Seems like you were planning something different
You put me right under your spell
Keep coming over every weekend

Hold my breath
We diving off the deep end
Pull me closer tell me what you thinking
Supernatural magic when you speaking
You got me out of my head

How'd you make the time stop
oooooo
Whenever you're around my head is in the clouds
You're dancing in your white socks
oooooo
Now I can slow it down
I wanna scream it out
You got me like
oooooo
I think I'm so in love with you
How'd you make the time stop
oooooo

Lyrics:

Teardrops
On the dance floor,
Saw you with her
Through the lights.

You seem happy,
Hope she gives you
All the love
You couldn’t find.

When we were together,
When you touched my, touched my soul,
Some things change forever,
When you lose it, lose it all.

Looking for you,
I don’t know where my heart went,
Drinking my love away,
Wishing I was okay.

Looking for you,
Pieces of your mad love,
Listening to sad songs,
Wishing I could be her.

Lost in
All these memories,
Wishing I could
Turn back time.

Heart’s still aching
Since you broke me,
Thought we’d make it,
I was blind.

When we were together,
When you touched my, touched my soul,
Some things change forever,
When you lose it, lose it all.

Looking for you,
I don’t know where my heart went,
Drinking my love away,
Wishing I was okay.

Looking for you,
Pieces of your mad love,
Listening to sad songs,
Wishing I could be her.",353,213121,6,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EW5p4vP_0q4/default.jpg,12:00:18,19/01/2024

Lyrics: 
I just wanna

I feel like startin’ something 
You got my engine runnin’ 
You got the keys to turn me on and on 
You got me acceleratin’ I want to celebrate it 
Can’t nothing take me out my zone 
It’s on 

When it feels right nothing else matters  
Is this real life too good to be true 
Take me all night 
I can feel the passion  
In your eyes 
I’m still in love with you 

You know I can’t get enough 
I love that shit
You know I can’t get enough 
You love that shit
You know I can’t get enough
Give me all that shit
Can’t get enough 
You know I can’t get enough

You know you the reason why they hatin on me boo

Ha, he romantic but street too, ha 
Drop a bag on a, what 
Put them m’s on my ass like evisu 
Yuh, I love that shit, 
Throwin up gang so they know I’m his bitch 
That’s boo daddy, he do anything to keep his boo happy 

‘Cuz bae it feels like  
Nothing else matters

LYRICS

Late night
You and I
Post fight
It’s my life

Let’s roll 
There’s the door 
I’m all for
4-4

I watch you walk away 
It’s just another day 
Don’t need you to stay 
I am not afraid
I know I’ll be ok
There’s nothing you can say

I just wanna dance alone 
I ain’t ever going home
I just wanna dance alone
I just wanna dance alone
I just wanna lose my phone 
I just wanna dance alone

I just wanna dance alone 
I just wanna dance alone 
I just wanna dance alone 
I just wanna dance alone

Won’t stop 
Can’t stop 
No clock 
Another shot 
Happy
So free 
Look at me 
Finally

I watch you walk away
It’s just another day
Don’t need you to stay
I am not afraid
I know I’ll be ok
There’s nothing you can say

I just wanna dance alone 
I ain’t ever going home
I just wanna dance alone
I just wanna dance alone
I just wanna lose my phone 
I just wanna dance alone

I just wanna dance alone 
I just wanna dance alone 
I just wanna dance alone 
I just wanna dance alone 
I just wanna dance alone 
I just wanna dance alone 
I just wanna dance alone 
I just wanna dance alone 
I just wanna dance alone 
I just wanna dance alone 

I just wanna dance alone 
I ain’t ever going home
I just wanna dance alone
I just wanna dance alone
I just wanna lose my phone 
I just wanna dance alone

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

Lyrics:

Somethings got a hold of me lately 
No, I don’t know myself anymore 
Feels like the walls are all closing in 
And the devil’s knocking at my door 
Woooahhh
Out of my mind, how many times 
Did I tell you I’m no good at being alone 
Yea, it’s taking a toll on me 
Trying my best to keep from tearing the skin off my bones 
Don’t you know
I lose control 
When you’re not next to me 
I’m falling apart right in front of you 
Can’t you see 
I lose control 
When you’re not next to me, mhm 
Yea, you’re breaking my heart 
You make a mess of me 
Problematic problem is I want your body like a fiend 
like a bad habit 
Bad habits hard to break when I’m with you 
Yeah I know I could do it on my own but I want 
That real full moon black magic and it takes two 
Problematic problem is when I’m with you I’m an addict 
And I need some release 
My skin in your teeth 
Can’t see the forest through the trees 
Got down on my knees 
Darlin, please 
Oooohhhh 
I lose control 
When you’re not next to me 
I’m falling apart right in front of you 
Can’t you see 
I lose control 
When you’re not next to me, mhmmm 
Yea, you’re breaking my heart baby 
You make a mess of me, yeahhh 
I lose control 
When you’re not here with me, mhmm 
I’m falling apart right in front of you 
Can’t you see 
I lose control 
When you’re not here with me, mhm 
Yea, you’re breaking my heart baby 
You make a mess of me, yeahhh

Lyrics:
Hurry up! Let’s go there’s our radio show
You can be whoever that you want
Livin’ a life that passes faster then the days
Breathing in the night
Remember Home
   
Oh I… Remember Home
Remember Home

Oh I… Remember Home!
Fighting the night playing rock ’n’ roll
Explore the world!
Dancing the night in a disco show
Let’s fly away!
Over the rainbow to hyperspace
Forget the time!
Here’s the future we’ve learned to fly and I...
Remember Home

Many times I told myself you’re not alone
Hey come on let’s go it ain’t the end
Once upon a time…
The story of every love
Oh baby please don’t cry
Remember Home
 
Oh I… Remember Home
Remember Home

Oh I… Remember Home!
Fighting the night playing rock ’n' roll
Explore the world!
Dancing the night in a disco show
Let’s fly away!
Over the rainbow to hyperspace
Forget the time!
Here’s the future we’ve learned to fly and I...

Lyrics: 
He said, are you serious
I’ve tried but i can’t figure out
I’ve been next to you all night and still don’t know what you’re about 
You keep talking
But not much coming out your mouth
Can’t you tell that i want you ?” 
I say, yeah

I would want myself 
Baby please believe me
I’ll put you through hell just to know me (ya ya) 
So sure of yourself 
Baby don’t get greedy 
That shit won’t end well
No it won’t end well 

I see you eyeing me down
But you’ll never know much past my name 
Or how i’m running this room around
And that i’m still half your age
Yeah you’re l-l-looking at me like i’m some sweet escape 
Obvious that you want me but i said

I would want myself
Baby please believe me
I’ll put you through hell just to know me yeah yeah 
So sure of yourself
Baby don’t get greedy
That shit won’t end well
No it won’t end well 

He said, “i’m just curious
Is this for real or just an act
Can’t tell if you love or hate me 
Never met someone like that
Drive me so so so crazy
Did you know you got that effect?”
I said, “lemme check”

Yeah
I would want myself
Baby please believe me 
I’ll put you through hell 
Just to know me yeah yeah 
So sure of yourself
Baby don’t get greedy
That shit won’t end well (end well)
No it won’t end well

I would want myself
I would want myself

Lyrics:
One, one, one, one, one...

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I... (I got new...)

One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
You're gettin' over him

“Even When The Sun is Dead” Lyrics: 

if you asked id oblige
i would die in your arms
and if heaven and hell
are only miles apart
and there's fog on the road
and my high beams are on
i muttered prose as a joke
and my high beams were on

and if you asked
id oblige i would drown in your wake
i've heard heaven itself
was not mine to obtain
but they lied oh they lied
because i've seen it in your face
and the high beams were on
bet there still on to this day

can't help it but be scared a bit
but fuck me im scared all the time
recently i've realized
that death is not an opposite
suppose it's just a part of life
i envy all the little things
the dirt
the air
the fathers eyes
cause they know you more than i ever will
no matter how hard i try
no matter how hard i try

it really gets to me some nights that i have it all except for time
it really gets to me some nights that i have it all except for time
it really gets to me some nights that i have it all except for time
even when the sun is dead, will you tell them how hard i tried?

if you asked id oblige
i would die in your arms
and if heaven and hell
are only miles apart
and there's fog on the road
and my high beams are on
i muttered prose as a joke
and my high beams were on

LYRICS
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.

Uh!
I'm gonna kick my feet up
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't

I'll be lounging on the couch,
Just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all!
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh

Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out: 'This is Great' (Oh my God, this is great)
Yeah

I might mess around, get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait
Haha

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Telling myself I won't go there
Oh, but I know that I won't care
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt
This lust is a burden that we both share
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
Souls tied, intertwined by pride and guilt

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) There's darkness in the distance
From the way that I've been livin'
(Ooh) But I know I can't resist it

[Chorus]
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from thе daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hatе it at the same time

[Verse 2]
Tellin' myself it's the last time
Can you spare any mercy that you might find
If I'm down on my knees again?
Deep down, way down, Lord, I try
Try to follow your light, but it's nighttime
Please don't leave me in the end

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) There's darkness in the distance
I'm beggin' for forgiveness
(Ooh) But I know I might resist it, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

#MeghanTrainor #AllAboutThatBass #Pop

Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines working that Photoshop
We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along

[Chorus]
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

[Verse 2]
Hey, I'm bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that
No, I'm just playing I know you think you're fat
But I'm here to tell you
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along


[Chorus]
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble

🎤 Lyrics: Ellie Goulding - Love Me Like You Do

You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me to the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (yeah)
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (yeah)
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (oh)
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Lyrics: 

We’ve been working all day
Let’s kick back and take a little break
The sunset is shining its light on you again
Download tell me everything
Highs lows and in betweens 
You’re in slow motion like a movie scene so beautiful
And I know everything is right where it should be

We’re in the kitchen eating ramen
We’ve got a candlelit table set for two
I love our little apartment
‘Cause it’s making me feel so close to you
And now I’m taking a picture in my head
So I can remember this moment
Here in the kitchen eating ramen
Got everything I ever wanted

We were thinking the same thing
Let’s tuck away all the pressure from outside
I wanna find your legs in the duvet ’til it’s
Past 5 and the sunshine fades in
Baby my whole solar system
Revolves around you     
And I know everything is right where it should be

We’re in the kitchen eating ramen
We’ve got a candlelit table set for two
I love our little apartment
‘Cause it’s making me feel so close to you
And now I’m taking a picture in my head
So I can remember this moment
Here in the kitchen eating ramen
Got everything I ever wanted

Baby I’ve got all that I want
Oh baby I’ve got all that I need
Oh baby I know that we belong together

Baby I’ve got all that I want
Oh baby I’ve got all that I need
Oh baby hope it feels like this forever",3196,106300,105,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cJuI4ThnnRc/default.jpg,04:30:11,08/12/2023

Lyrics:
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don’t want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we’re running out of time
Trying to catch the beat make up your mind
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You’re so indecisive of what I’m saying
Don’t want us to end where do I start
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
First you up and you’re down and then between

Ohh I really want to know…

When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
But you tell me to go
Said we’re running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You’re overprotective when I’m leaving
Trying to compromise but I can’t win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start won’t let this end
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you’re down and then between
Ohh I really want to know…
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
What do you mean?
When you don’t want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we’re running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

Lyrics:
I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?

Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?

'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might

Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm

When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?

'Cause I, 'cause I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might

Think I forgot how to be happy
Somethin' I'm not, but somethin' I can be
Somethin' I wait for
Somethin' I'm made for
Somethin' I'm made for

LYRICS

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go 
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

I used to know
That I used to know

Somebody...

Lyrics:

I've been here all night (Ariana)
I've been here all day (Nicki Minaj)
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
(Let them hoes know)
I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' ('Bout nothin')
I'm comin' at ya
'Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' ('Bout nothin')
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them no, 'cause I
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)
Been tryna hide it
Baby what's it gonna hurt if they don't know?
Makin' everybody think that we solo
Just as long as you know you got me (You got me)
And boy I got ya
'Cause tonight I'm making deals with the devil
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
Just as long as you know you got me
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them no, 'cause
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)
I've been here all night
(Been here all night, baby)
I've been here all day
(Been here all day, baby)
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)
This the new style with the fresh type of flow
Wrist icicle, ride dick bicycle
Come true yo, get you this type of blow
If you wanna menage I got a tricycle
All these bitches, flows is my mini-me
Body smoking, so they call me young Nicki chimney
Rappers in they feelings cause they feelin' me
Uh, I-I give zero fucks and I got zero chill in me
Kissing me, copped the blue box that say Tiffany
Curry with the shot, just tell 'em to call me Stephanie
Gun pop and I make my gum pop
I'm the queen of rap, young Ariana run pop
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give him up
Can't hear them no, 'cause I
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)
I've been here all night
(Been here all night baby)
I've been here all day
(Been here all day baby)
Boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)
This the new style with the fresh type of flow
Wrist icicle, ride dick bicycle
Come true yo, get you this type of blow
If you wanna menage I got a tricycle

Grammy nominated artist/writer/producer SMITH is back with RUN a new alt/pop smash that builds on her recent radio and viral success and just hit the Mediabase/Billboard Top 40/CHR Charts at #38.  

With over 150 million streams worldwide and a Grammy nomination for Jack Harlow’s album “Come Home The Kids Miss You”, SMITH’s last release ""Lemon"" charted at Top 40, Hot AC, Rhythmic and Alternative Radio making her the first woman since Billie Eilish in 2019 to chart at all 4 genres and was a TikTok Viral sensation with over 150 million impressions and led to her being named a TikTok emerging artist. 

Despite all the success, SMITH has NEVER revealed her face or her identity.  SMITH says, “The simple truth is, I hate seeing myself.  I don’t know why, not exactly.  Maybe it’s a disorder of some kind.  Maybe it’s society and what I’m told a woman is to look like.  Maybe it’s that it feels a little vain to me.  Maybe it’s that I’m too vein.  Maybe it’s a fear of people.  Maybe image is a game I’m not equipped to play or keep up with.  Maybe I’m afraid it’ll take something from the art vs. add to it.  Maybe it’s my past.  Maybe it’s my programming.  Maybe I’m messed up and tomorrow it’ll all be different.  It’s hard to know what might happen.  Hopefully I won’t be this afraid forever.  I just do what I can.  The most important thing is the music.  I live in service of the songs.",0,20834,6,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gRxuXgi9F3o/default.jpg,16:45:42,18/02/2024

i’ll never be the same
but when i look back
Yesterday was as far as i could go
I should’ve known

am i foolish for thinking
that i could run right through the fire
and not get burned

Lyrics: 
Baby you can
Find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up
Don’t you wanna just
Come along for the ride

Oh my outfit so tight
You can see my heart beat tonight
I can take the heat
Baby best believe
That’s the moment I shine

Cuz every romance
Shakes and it bends
Don’t give a damn

When the nights here
I don’t do tears
Baby no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

Lately I’ve been
Moving close to the edge
Still be looking my best
I stay on the beat
You can count on me
I ain’t missing no steps

Cuz every romance
Shakes and it bends
Don’t give a damn

When the nights here
I don’t do tears
Baby no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance 
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face 
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks
You’ll never see it, never see it
When my world shakes
I feel alive, I feel alive
I don’t play safe
Don’t you know about me

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Even when the tears are flowing
They’re diamonds on my face
I’ll still keep the party going not one hair out of place
Even when the tears are flowing
They’re diamonds on my face
I’ll still keep the party going not one hair out of place

Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks
You’ll never see it, never see it
When my world shakes
I feel alive, I feel alive
I don’t play safe
Don’t you know about me

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

LYRICS
Oh, her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying 
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so, sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look ok, I say

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing, just the way you are. Yeah.

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she let me
Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

Oh, you know, you know, you know, I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So, don't even bother asking if you look ok
You know I'll say

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing, just the way you are
The way you are, the way you are
Girl you're amazing, just the way you are

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are. Yeah.

“I Ain’t Worried” Lyrics:
i don’t know what you’ve been told
but time is running out no need to take it slow
im stepping to you toe to toe
i should be scared honey maybe so

but i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below

i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it

I don’t know what you’ve been told
but time is running out so spend it like its gold
im living like I’m 9 zeros
got no regrets even when I’m broke
yeah
im at my best when i got something
im wanting to steal
way too busy for them problems
and problems to feel (yeah yeah)
no stressing just obsessin with sealin the deal
ill take it in and let it go

but i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below

i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it

oooooooooo
i aint worried
oooooooo
oh no no

i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below
i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it

IN LOVE AGAIN (Radio Edit)
Lyrics  and music by Klaus Rieger

In love again –  that night when I drowned in your eyes
In love again – since I wandered with you through the skies
In love again – when we laid down our heads in the clouds
In love again – since our hearts got away from all doubts

I was looking for another night time lover
I was looking for another one night stand
In love again

In love again –  that night when I drowned in your eyes
In love again – since I wandered with you through the skies
In love again – when we laid down our heads in the clouds
In love again – since our hearts got away from all doubts

But now again the sun is shining like before
In a time that seems long ago
And now again the fear is hiding behind hope
Loneliness set me free again
And now again I feel that I am
In love again

In love again – since our hearts got away from all doubts
But now again the sun is shining like before
In a time that seems long ago
And now again the fear is hiding behind hope
Loneliness set me free again
And now again I feel that I am

In love again
in love again
in love again
in love

Love in a thousand different flavors
I wish that I could taste them all tonight
No, I ain't got no dinner plans
So you should bring all your friends
I swear that a-all y'all my type

All you girls in here, if you're feeling thirsty
Come on take a sip 'cause you know what I'm servin', ooh

Shimmy shimmy yay, shimmy yay, shimmy ya (Drank)

Shimmy shimmy shimmy yay, shimmy yah
Bad girls gon' swalla-la-la
Bust down on my wrist in this bitch
My pinky-ring bigger than his
Met her out in Beverly Hills, ay
Dolla got too many girls, ay
Met her out in Beverly Hills
All she wear is red bottom heels
When she back it up, put it on the Snap
When she droppin' low, put it on the Gram
DJ poppin', she gon' swallow that
Champagne poppin', she gon' swallow that

Lyrics:
Uh oh
Uh oh
Uh oh
You made a mistake
Uh oh
Uh oh
Tell me things that can’t be true

Your slacks are on fire
I’m fanning the flames
Like a vampire
Stood out in broad day
Shoulda been wiser
While pickin’ out
What you were gonna say
oh

Fool me once
That’s one too many
Better luck next time you’ve met me
Where’s the dunce
Who caught you meddling

Turn around
Uh oh

Uh oh
Uh oh
Uh oh
You made a mistake
Uh oh
Uh oh
Tell me things that can’t be true

You’re sweating this time 
I’m reading your eyes 
You’re being called out 
‘Cause you slipped your mouth 
Your face has turned pale 
Gone faint, you’re not well 
While you were distracted 
I cast a spell 

Uh oh better run away now 
Uh oh you’ve made a mistake aw 
Uh oh got nothing else to say to you
Uh oh

Uh oh
Uh oh
Uh oh
You made a mistake
Uh oh
Uh oh
Tell me things that can’t be true

Forgive this wed intermission
Tragically I’m not the victim here
If only I fell for your fiction
Tell me things that can’t be true

Lyrics:

Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch youfixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again""",6846046,1697249808,171965,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OpQFFLBMEPI/default.jpg,22:00:58,05/02/2013

Lyrics:
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la, yeah

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la la la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall

Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you
All along I've been coming for you
And I hope it meant something to you
Call my name, I'll be coming for you
Coming for you, coming for you, coming for you

For you (ooh, she loves it when I come)
For you

Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you

#JamesArthur #SayYOuWontLetGo

-----------------------------------------------

Lyrics:
I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now
Oh, and you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
Finally it's just you and me till we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go",8946419,1650538321,182067,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0yW7w8F2TVA/default.jpg,07:00:00,09/09/2016

Lyrics
Nothing ever works in our favour
I’m just out here trying to savour

You were the first of your kind in my orbit
I wish the stars would align
But they don’t so I just absorb it

They don’t so I just absorb it
They don’t so I just absorb it
They don’t so I just absorb it
They don’t so I just absorb it

I need a signal
Some kind of flashing light
Some kind of sign
Something to ease my mind

Nothing ever works in our favour
You were the first of your kind in my orbit
I wish the stars would align
But they don’t so I just absorb it

They don’t so I just absorb it
They don’t so I just absorb it
They don’t so I just absorb it
They don’t so I just absorb it
They don’t so I just absorb it
They don’t so I just absorb it
They don’t so I just absorb it
They don’t so I just absorb it

Echoes find their way back to me
We’re aeons apart no it’s not meant to be this hard, this hard, this hard
All is said and done

Nothing ever, nothing ever, nothing ever, works in our favour
Nothing ever, nothing ever, nothing ever, works in our favour

You were the first of your kind
In my orbit
I wish the stars would align

Lyrics: 
lately, i think i think too much
always living in a rush
wish i knew how to turn it off 
i carry all this weight on my shoulder ‘til my back hurts
i’m stressed out ‘cause it feels like i just keep on going backwards 
one step forward, two steps back, i’m moonwalking like jackson
i’m way too overwhelmed but i can’t find the right distractions 

i’m switching to airplane mode 
and flying back home
all these cities seem so peaceful 
as i’m looking out the window 
this world doesn’t seem that evil 
when i switch to airplane mode 
and i fly back home
all my worries start to fade 
over skylines, over haze 
i’m heading to outer space 
and i really wanna stay 

lately, it’s always been the same 
and i think someday
i’ll pack my things and run away 
i keep trying to make it right, i need to meet these expectations 
sometimes i wish i could press pause, i’m losing all my patience 
can’t mess it up while i’m still trying to build up my foundations 
but kinda wanna make it stop

i’m switching to airplane mode 
and flying back home
all these cities seem so peaceful 
as i’m looking out the window 
this world doesn’t seem that evil 
when i switch to airplane mode 
and i fly back home
all my worries start to fade 
over skylines, over haze 
i’m heading to outer space
and i really wanna stay 

in airplane mode
and fly back home 
in airplane mode
fly back home 

i’m switching to airplane mode 
and flying back home
all these cities seem so peaceful 
as i’m looking out the window 
this world doesn’t seem that evil 
when i switch to airplane mode 
and i fly back home
all my worries start to fade 
over skylines, over haze 
i’m heading to outer space 
and i really wanna stay
in airplane mode

Lyrics

We, we don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They, they gonna see us from outer space
Outer space, light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

We don't wanna leave
No, we just wanna be right now, right, ri-ri-right now
And what we see, is everybody's on the floor
Acting crazy, getting loco 'til the light's out
Music's on, I'm waking up
We start the fire, and we burn it up
And it's over now, we got the love
There's no sleeping now, no sleeping now, sleeping now

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn (ooh)
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn (ooh)

We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn (let it burn)

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky (burn, burn, burn, burn, we gonna let it burn, burn, let it burn)
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we're gonna let it burn

Lyrics:

Boy, I get it,
It's hard to fall asleep
When your jealousy takes control.
Kind of selfish
To want me for yourself,
You go crazy when I'm out alone.
Zílevo, zílevo,
You see me walking out in my stilettos, stilettos.
And boy, it drives you crazy 'cause you don't know, zílevo,
If you'll ever see me coming back.
Not my problem,
You're feeling insecure
Every time I'm walking out that door.
It's not over,
I want to make it work,
But you gotta learn to trust me more.
Zílevo, zílevo,
You see me walking out in my stilettos, stilettos.
And boy, it drives you crazy 'cause you don't know, zílevo,
If you'll ever see me coming back.
Ooh,
You see me walking out in my stilettos,
And boy, it drives you crazy 'cause you don't know,
If you'll ever see me coming back.",3576,425112,122,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5ytUp88cdzo/default.jpg,14:45:13,12/01/2024

Lyrics:

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But, I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Sittin in the car 
Listening to Blonde
Fallin for eachother
pink & orange skies,
Feelin super childish
No donald glover 
Missed call from my mother
Like Where u at tonight
Got no alibi
I was all alone

With the love of my life 
Shes got glitter for skin
My Radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light

To see you shine
It's your golden hour
You slow down time
In your golden hour

we were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash
Driving nowhere fast 
Burnin through the summer
Radio on blast
make the moment last
She got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can u even imagine 
fallin like I did

For the love of my life 
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My Radiant beam in the night
I don’t need no light

Lyrics:

There’s a party in my hotel bar
You were standing there across the room
Never meant to fall right in your arms
Is it love or is it Deja Vu?

So we went to a party in Mexico City
He told me ""bella come with me""
He told me ""bella come with me""
(Bella don’t you wanna come?)
Come back to mi cassa chica que passa?
Podria ser el questa noche te abrasa
(E e )
Noche te abrasa

Cuz baby you know I just came to say hi
You make me wanna pray for one last night
There’s something in your eyes
That got me so high
I hope we’ll never say our last goodbye

I can see the sun light up the sky
Oh last night it just flashed right by
Never thought that I’ll miss you so much
Now I’m trying to forget your touch

So we went to a party in Mexico City
He told me ""bella come with me""
He told me ""bella come with me""
(Bella don’t you wanna come?)
Come back to mi cassa chica que passa?
Podria ser el questa noche abrasa
(E e )
Noche te abrasa

Cuz baby you know I just came to say hi
You make me wanna pray for one last night
There’s something in your eyes
That got me so high
I hope we’ll never say our last goodbye
Cuz baby you know I just came to say hi
You make me wanna pray for one last night
There’s something in your eyes
That got me so high
I hope we’ll never say our last goodbye",14260,4478000,392,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1j6Pfv6xS9o/default.jpg,15:04:21,15/06/2023

Lyrics:
We’re no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment’s what I’m thinking of
You wouldn’t get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I’m feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We’ve known each other for so long
Your heart’s been aching but you’re too shy to say it
Inside we both know what’s been going on
We know the game and we’re gonna play it

And if you ask me how I’m feeling
Don’t tell me you’re too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Lyrics

You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up, to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful
So come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why, you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful

Lyrics: 
Once I was seven years old my mama told me, 
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big, big world but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor 
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me, 
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
‘Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old my story got told
Before the morning sun when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old

I only see my goals I don't believe in failure
‘Cause I know the smallest voices they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave I hope I'll see you later

Once I was twenty years old my story got told 
I waswriting 'bout everything I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old

Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold 
We'vetraveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one 
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be sixty years old

Lyrics:
Every time you come around you know I can’t say no 
Every time the sun goes down I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
and tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won’t
I’ve got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can’t escape 
Nothing happens after two
It’s true it’s true
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Falling over everything to reach the first times spark
Started under neon lights then it all got dark 
I only know how to go too far 

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won’t
I’ve got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can’t escape 
Nothing happens after two
It’s true it’s true
My bad habits lead to you

We took the long way round
And burned til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won’t
I’ve got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can’t escape 
Nothing happens after two
It’s true it’s true
My bad habits lead to you

Lyrics: 

I cut my hair 
in the bathroom sink
look in the mirror
tell me what do you see 
empty promises 
a broken hearted kid
nothing to believe in
he’s bleeding
out

Can’t keep bleeding out

his mother told him
to keep his nose clean
shook hands with cocaine
and now he can’t sleep
these empty promises 
a broken hearted kid
there’s nothing to believe in
he’s bleeding
out

Can’t keep bleeding out
I can’t keep bleeding out
Cant keep bleeding out
Out

Don’t know how
to escape
this hell 
this maze 
someone help me find my way

Out

Can’t keep bleeding out",31,7278,4,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nv_dnLcy_ZY/default.jpg,05:00:24,19/01/2024

Lyrics:

Ooh
Na na, yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
So
I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time
I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said I make you cry when I run away
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (Ooh, yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (Ah)
I said save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

The official 'Too Good At Goodbyes' music video.

Lyrics:
You must think that I’m stupid
You must think that I’m a fool
You must think that I’m new to this
But I have seen this all before

I’m never going to let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up it hurts
So I’m never going to get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you’ll see me cry (No way that you’ll see me cry)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)

I know you’re thinking I’m heartless
I know you’re thinking I’m cold
I’m just protecting my innocence
I’m just protecting my soul

I’m never going to let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
‘Cause every time I open up it hurts
So I’m never going to get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you’ll see me cry (No way that you’ll see me cry)
I’m way too good at goodbyes (I’m way too good at goodbyes)

No…
(I’m way too good at goodbyes)
(I’m way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you’ll see me cry)
Oh…
(I’m way too good at goodbyes)

‘Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true
I’m way too good at goodbyes

Lyrics: Cosmin Buzgure

It’s the end of the world
And you know it
As I slowly sink into you deep blue eyes
If you feel taken back
It’s the motion of the time
And we’re slowly dancing to the what’s left behind

It’s a heartbreak
And I’m losing all my
Faith as I’m going down
It’s a heartache 
You’re just wasting all with my time
We’re running out

Every sunset, 
Every night we laid 
In rooms that we once knew
Now we’re lying on the ground
We’re almost dead

We’re fighting over nothing
Now it’s midnight and we’re scared
Now it’s quiet and we’re dancing ’til the end

It’s a heartbreak
And I’m losing all my
Faith as I’m going down
It’s a heartache 
You’re just wasting all with my time
We’re running out

►Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I’ve ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices, they come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming one day I’ll watch as you’re leaving ‘cause you got tired of my scheming - for the last time

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I’m a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman 
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming 
one day I’ll watch as you’re leaving and life will lose all its meaning - for the last time 

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers ‘round and reads it
And then someone screams out
“She’s laughing up at us from hell!”

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me

It’s me
Hi

Everybody agrees
Everybody agrees

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Lyrics:

Verse 1:
Every night, I've been calling, like you've got me hypnotised
Can't help myself,
It's like all the time, I try to be without you, but you're on my mind, every single night

Pre-Chorus:
I tell myself that I'll be better off without you, but you and I know that's a lie
And I can't get you out of my mind
It's like you've got me hypnotised

Drop:
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah
I can't get you out of my mind
I'm hypnotised

Post-Chorus:
And if only you would say that I do the very same to you
That I'm on your mind
Tell me it’s true
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah
I can't get you out of my mind
I'm hypnotised

Verse 2:
Don't let me down,
Don't say when you hear my name, it doesn’t resonate,
Within your head,
Is it hurting now, like me when I just need you, but you're not around

Pre-Chorus:
I tell myself that I’ll be better off without you, but you and I know that’s a lie
And I can't get you out of my mind
It's like you've got me hypnotised

Drop:
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah
I can’t get you out of my mind
I'm hypnotised",4186,2727839,53,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KfLHFau7rsE/default.jpg,13:00:18,04/01/2024

Lyrics:

Uh huh, it's Iggy Iggz
I got one more problem with you girl
Aye
Hey, baby even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya
I want you
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to
I want you
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it
I want you
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
But it's you
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back
But it's you
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it
But it's you
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
It's Iggy Iggz, uh
What you got?
Smart money bettin', I'll be better off without you
In no time, I'll be forgettin' all about you
You saying that you know
But I really really doubt you
Understand my life is easy
When I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressing
I'm thinking I love the thought of you
More than I love your presence
And the best thing now
Is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back
I finally learned my lesson
No half-stepping
Either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listening to you knowin'
I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo
So don't be dumb
I got ninety-nine problems
But you won't be one
Like what!
One less, one less problem
One less, one less problem
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem",7000080,1399956797,284345,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iS1g8G_njx8/default.jpg,20:00:01,30/05/2014

LYRICS:
Oh it’s like that
I’m your dream come true
When it’s on a platter for you
then you pull back
When i try to make plans
More than 2 hours in advance
I slam the door
I hit ignore
I’m saying no no no no more i
Got u blocked
After this
An after thought
I finally cut you off
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
with you off my mind
Floating through
The memories like whatever
You’re a waste of time
Your Signals are Mixed
You act like a bitch
you fit every stereotype
send a pic
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
With you out my life
It Feels
So
Good
Not caring where u are tonight
And it feels so good
Not pretending to like the wine u like
I slam the door
I hit ignore
I’m saying no no no no more i
Got u blocked
Excited
To never talk
I I’m so sorry for your loss
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
with you off my mind
Floating through
The memories like whatever
You’re a waste of time
your Signals are Mixed
You act like a bitch
you fit every stereotype
send a pic
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
With you out my life
You want me
I’m done
You miss me
No duh
Where I’m at
I’m up
/ like a feather like a feather like a feather

Lyrics:

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (yeah)
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""
Happiness is the same price as red bottoms
My smile is beamin', my skin is gleamin'
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (you've seen it)
I bought a crib just for the closet
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
Yeah, my receipts, be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, ""Put it in the bag, "" yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, give me the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)

Lyrics:
Been runnin on these lonely streets
For so long
To put my mind at ease
With this song
Lalarilari lalarirari lalarirari
Im Done

They said be the person you needed as a kid
But life just a circle of mess were you cant breath
So i put my mind at ease
With this song
Lalalrirari Lalarirari
I’m Done

Foot loose and fancy free
I dance just to release my dopamine
Overdosed by society
I'm breaking up with those who limit me

Cause I just want
This night
To last
Forever

They said be the person you needed as a kid
But life just a circle of mess were you cant breath
So i put my mind at ease
With this song
Lalalrirari Lalarirari
I’m Done

LYRICS
 
hate to give the satisfaction asking how you’re doing now
how’s the castle built off people you pretend to care about
just what you wanted
look at you, cool guy, you got it
 
i see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when i close my eyes
six months of torture
that you sold as some forbidden paradise
i loved you truly
gotta laugh at the stupidity
 
cuz i’ve made some real big mistakes
but you make the worst one look fine
i should’ve known it was strange
you only come out at night
i used to think i was smart
but you made
me look so naive
the way you sold me for parts
as you sunk your teeth into me, oh
bloodsucker, famefucker
bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire
 
every girl i ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
you called them crazy god i hate the way i called them crazy too
you’re so convincing
how do you lie without flinching
(how do you lie, how do you lie, how do you lie)
 
oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
can’t figure out just how you do it and god knows i never will
went for me and not her
cuz girls your age know better
 
i’ve made some real big mistakes
but you make the worst one look fine
i should’ve known it was strange
you only come out at night
i used to think i was smart
but you made me look so naive
the way you sold me for parts
as you sunk your teeth into me, oh
bloodsucker, famefucker
bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire
 
you said it was true love
but wouldn’t that be hard
you can’t love anyone
cuz that would mean you had a heart
i tried you help you out
now i know that i can’t
cuz how you think’s the kind of thing
i’ll never understand
 
i’ve made some real big mistakes
but you make the worst one look fine
i should’ve known it was strange
you only come out at night
i used to think i was smart
but you made me look so naive
the way you sold me for parts
as you sunk your teeth into me, oh
bloodsucker, famefucker
bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

I'm so broke,
Got no cash, I spent it.
Yesterday, I was rich.

Check my phone,
On Google, Louis Vuitton, Yeezys, even Abercrombie and Fitch.

'Cause I be
Walking down the street like I own it,
Like I own it.
If you look at me, you'd swear I'm made of cash,
Made of cash.

Walking in this club like I own it,
Like I own it.
If you think I'm made of cash, it's 'cause I am.

I got that
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip.
I got that
Steeze, steeze, steeze, steeze, steeze, steeze, steeze, steeze.

Lyrics:

And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons

Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
But your blade - it mightbe too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

Lyrics:

I left a note on my bedpost
Said not to repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory

The way he makes me feel yeah, gotta hold on me
I've never met someone so different
Oh here we go
You a part of me now, you a part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

Ohohohoh ohohohoh
I can't remember to forget you
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me, the only memory,
Is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
I can't remember to forget you
Ooooh
I can't remember to forget you
Ohohohoh ohohohoh""

Lyrics:
I know what's to be sacred
Always knew
I know a lot of secrets
Don't know you

And everyone's gone now
Just the two of us
I know a lot of secrets
But don't know you

Biting my lips, longing for you, you
Searching for the room with open doors, we close them
Everything we do can be a secret that we keep
A secret that we keep

I just want your love
Your love
Your love can take me higher

I just want your love
Your love
So we can start a fire

I know what's to be sacred
Always knew
I know a lot of secrets
Don't know you

And everyone's gone now
Just the two of us
I know a lot of secrets
But don't know you

Biting my lips, longing for you, you
Searching for the room with open doors, we close them
Everything we do can be a secret that we keep
A secret that we keep

I just want your love
Your love
Your love can take me higher

I just want your love
Your love
So we can start a fire",17414,12250563,134,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v895UsLmfnI/default.jpg,14:00:43,25/04/2023

5th of November
When I walked you home
that’s when I nearly said it but then said forget it and froze
Do you remember
You probably don’t
Cuz the sparks in the sky took a hold of your eyes while we spoke

Yesterday
drank way too much and stayed up too late
I started to write what i wanna say
deleted the message but i still remember it said

I wish I
was who you drunk texted at midnight
wish I was the reason you stay up till 3 and you can’t fall asleep
waiting for me to reply


I wish I 
was more than just someone you walk by
wish i wasn’t scared to be honest and open
instead of just hoping
you’d feel what i’m feeling inside

april the 7th
And nothing has changed
It’s hard to get by when you’re still on my mind everyday
Sometimes I wonder
If you feel the same
Do we make stupid jokes tryna hide that we’re both too afraid to say

I wish I
was who you drunk texted at midnight
wish I was the reason you stay up till 3 and you can’t fall asleep
waiting for me to reply

I wish I
was more than just someone you walk by
wish I wasn’t scared to be honest and open
instead of just hoping
you’d feel what i’m feeling inside

Oh and here we go again
Destroy myself to keep a friend
Hiding away
Cuz I was afraid you’d say no
I wonder if I cross your mind
Half as much as you do mine
If I tell you the truth
What would you do I don’t know

I wish I
Had sent you that drunk text at midnight
I was just scared it would ruin our friendship
But i really meant it
I wonder how you would reply",316761,35551473,3590,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OqEc_169ywY/default.jpg,16:00:19,10/02/2023

Lyrics:
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm only good at being bad, bad

I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

Lyrics:

I guess your lips taste like they used to,
Maybe it's me, but lately, I don't feel you.
For quite some time, feeling like I'm on my own,
With or without you,
Too much time alone.

Too many fights causing heartache,
Too many sleepless nights,
But there's so much a heart can take,
And I think I'm losing my mind.
No more pain, no more going insane,
It became just a complicated game,
So simplified, where your love fade again.

If you love me, let me go (x2).

Being single is not what it used to,
Now I know we had it so good.
I'm on my knees, won't you please just take me back,
But you've already packed.
Just hold me, but you can't.

Too many fights causing heartache,
Too many sleepless nights,
But there's so much a heart can take,
And I think I'm losing my mind.
No more pain, no more going insane,
It became just a complicated game,
So simplified, where your love fade again.

If you love me, let me gooo (x3).",1699,483178,111,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8T5EeZGdzXQ/default.jpg,09:02:34,09/01/2024

Lyrics:
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you P.M.S.
Like a bitch
I would know
And you over-think
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you’re no good for me
 
(Chorus)
‘Cause you’re hot then you’re cold
You’re yes then you’re no
You’re in then you’re out
You’re up then you’re down
You’re wrong when it’s right
It’s black and it’s white
We fight we break up
We kiss we make up
 
You, you don’t really wanna stay no
You, but you don’t really wanna go o
You’re hot then you’re cold
You’re yes then you’re no
You’re in then you’re out
You’re up then you’re down
 
We used to be
Just like twins
So in sync
The same energy
Now’s a dead battery
Used to laugh
About nothing
Now you’re plain boring
I should know
That you’re not gonna change
 
(Chorus)
‘Cause you’re hot then you’re cold
You’re yes then you’re no
You’re in then you’re out
You’re up then you’re down
You’re wrong when it’s right
It’s black and it’s white
We fight we break up
We kiss we make up

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
And I can’t get off this ride…
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
 
(Chorus)
‘Cause you’re hot then you’re cold
You’re yes then you’re no
You’re in then you’re out
You’re up then you’re down
You’re wrong when it’s right
It’s black and it’s white
We fight we break up
We kiss we make up

Lyrics:

You're welcome to give us a reason to stay here,
But right now, we both know that's so hard to find.
So what if they call us a couple of runaways?
Don't hide on a cloud in the sky,
We will run to the spark in your eyes.
Give us love, give us space to survive.

That's why I'm walkin’ to the moon,
And love is what I'm takin’ you.
Tonight the sky is clear, there’s like we're half way there.
That's why I'm walkin’ to the moon.

We'll get a cruise around the stars,
And a private trip to Mars.
But I'd share the galaxy with you.
Take a minute, find the gravity in love,
I'll be your faithful satellite to you.

That's why I'm walkin’ to the moon,
And love is what I'm takin’ you.
Tonight the sky is clear; it's like we're halfway there.
That's why I'm walking to the moon.

That's why I'm walking to the moon,
And love is what I'm taking you.
Tonight the sky is clear, there’s like we're halfway there.
That's why I'm walkin’ to the moon.",1926,1008616,65,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OpiuFITNzEs/default.jpg,14:00:24,14/12/2023

I don't wanna go
But baby we both know
This is not our time
It’s time to say goodbye
Until we meet again
Cuz this is not the end
It will come a day
When we will find our way

Violins playing and the angels crying
When the stars align then I’ll be there

Oh I don't care about them all
Cuz all I want is to be loved
And all I care about is you
U stuck on me like a tattoo
No I don't care about the pain
I’ll walk through fire and through rain
Just to get closer to you
U stuck on me like a tattoo

I'm letting my hair down
I'm taking it cool
U got my heart in your hand
Don't lose it my friend
It's all that I got

Violins playing and the angels crying
When the stars align then I’ll be there

Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)

Guess it’s true
I’m not good
At a one night stand
But I still need love
Cos I’m just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don’t want you to leave
Will you hold my hand

Oh won’t you
Stay with me
Cos you’re
All I need
This aint love
It’s clear to see
But darling
Stay with me

Why am I so emotional?
No it’s not a good look
Gain some self control
Deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me
So it doesn’t hurt

Oh won’t you
Stay with me
Cos you’re
All I need
This aint love
It’s clear to see
But darling
Stay with me
Oh won’t you

Lyrics:

We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell.
A love no onecould deny

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me""",7125667,1191861143,1090166,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/My2FRPA3Gf8/default.jpg,16:00:38,09/09/2013

Lyrics:

Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up (oh, yeah)
I'm pickin' it up (yeah), pickin' it up (yeah)
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up
Yeah, we turnin' it up
Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but boy, I like it, I like it, I like it
Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it
We're out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now, can't stop so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth, and if you don't know
Then now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in, like, all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (oh yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Oh, I just want you to come with me
We're on another mentality
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up (oh, yeah)
Yeah, we turnin' it up
They point out the colors in you, I see 'em too
And, boy, I like 'em, I like 'em, I like 'em
We're way too fly to partake in all this hate
We out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now, can't stop, so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth, and if you don't know
Then now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in, like, all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (oh yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Oh, I just want you to come with me
We're on another mentality
Ain't got no tears left to cry (so don't cry)
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (oh yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now
Shut your mouth
Ain't got no tears left to cry
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, I just want you to come with me
We're on another mentality
Ain't got no tears left to cry (cry)
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (oh yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Pickin' it up (yeah), pickin' it up (yeah)
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up
Yeah, we turnin' it up

Lyrics

PinkPantheress: 
take a look inside your heart 
is there any room for me
i won’t ever have to hold my breath 
till you get down on one knee 
because 
you only want to hold me when i’m looking good enough
did you ever feel me 
could you ever picture us 

every time i pull my hair 
well it’s only our of fear 
that you’ll find me ugly 
and one day you’ll disappear
because 
what’s the point of crying it was never even love
did you ever want me was i ever good enough 
 
the boys a liar 
the boys a liar 
he doesn’t see you 
you’re not looking at me boy 
the boys a liar 
the boys a liar 
he doesn’t see you 
you’re not looking at me boy 

good enough nough nough
good enough nough nough
good enough nough nough
good enough nough nough

Ice Spice: 

he say that I’m good enough 
grabbin’ my duhduhduh
thinkin’ bout shit that I shouldn’ta 
so I tell him there’s one of me 
he making fun of me, his girl is a bum to me 
like that boy is a cap, saying he home but I know where he at like
bet he’s blowing her back, thinking bout me cos he knows that it’s fat
and it been what it been, calling his phone like “yo send me a pin”
ducking my shit cus he know what I’m on 
but when he hit me Im not gon’ respond 
but I don’t sleep enough without you 
and I can’t eat enough without you 
if we don’t speak does that mean we’re through?
don’t like sneaky shit that you do 

PinkPantheress: 

the boys a liar 
the boys a liar 
he doesn’t see you 
you’re not looking at me boy 
the boys a liar 
the boys a liar 
he doesn’t see you 
you’re not looking at me boy 

good enough nough nough
good enough nough nough
good enough nough nough
good enough nough nough
good enough nough nough
good enough nough nough

Directed by Nabil

""Today, I get to share with you the visual companion piece to my new single, 'Grenade.' The song is about loving someone so deeply, and the pain of knowing that the person you love does not feel the same. The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate."" -- Bruno Mars

LYRICS
Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya

I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no

Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from
Mad women, bad women, that's just what you are, yeah
You'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya

I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

But darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya

I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you never do the same
No, no, no, no

When @bastilledan sent me happier for the first time I was taken back. The amount of emotion that you could feel in the lyrics was crazy. As I listened to the song more and more it reminded me of so many things I’ve been through in my life. Toxic relationships, letting go of things I didn’t want to and just situations where happiness came with a sacrifice. Recently I lost my best friend, my companion, my life long friend. I wanted this video to embrace the pain that we feel losing or sacrificing something and the cycle of life that comes with it. I hope this song and video can bring closure in any situation you may be and make us all happier 💛

Lyrics: 

You left me last night
Awake in my dreams
The morning feels now
And I'm wide asleep
Those movies of love sound
Don't tell it like this
I took my best shot
So, why did I miss?

Should I let it all go?
Let it all go now?
Let it take toll
Let it take toll
Should I run to your door?
Tell you I'm so sorry
I wanna change the ending of the story

Take me back
To the days of summer
Back to being lovers
To the times I thought the sun won't set
Take me back
Let's forgive each other
Let the rains of summer
Come pouring down
And wash our problems away

Take me to evergreen
Everlasting sunset
Like the sky on fire
Remember how it feels
Taking back the days
To “once upon a time”
Yeah
Watching those movies that we never liked
The credits are rolling
Let's not say goodbye
Oooh oh oh
Ooh oh no-no

Should I let it all go?
Let it all go now?
Let it take toll
Let it take toll
Should I run to your door?
Tell you I'm so sorry
I wanna change the ending of the story

Take me back
To the days of summer
Back to being lovers
To the times I thought the sun won't set
Take me back
Let's forgive each other
Let the rains of summer
Come pouring down
And wash our problems away",5819,2806613,289,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4iSkpiLg9Bc/default.jpg,08:00:11,14/09/2023

Lyrics:

Lonely, thinking about the times when you called me,
I’m always on your mind when you're going down, down, down.
You always bring me down, down, down.

Tell me, how come when I'm guiding your steps,
It's always hard to see?
How come you don't want to confess?
Now it's too late; I'm done.

Yeah, I don’t need you when
Lonely, thinking about the times when you called me.
I’m always on your mind when you're going down, down, down.
You always bring me down, down, down.",809,314199,8,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l8HrANCNuik/default.jpg,15:30:10,15/12/2023

Lyrics:
There ain’t no gold
In this river
That I’ve been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope
In these waters
But I can’t bring myself to swim 
When I am drowning 
In this silence baby let me in
 
Go easy on me baby
I was still a child
Didn’t get the chance to 
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me
 
There ain’t no room 
For things to change
When we are both so deeply 
Stuck in our ways
You can’t deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was
To put you both first
But now I give up 
 
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn’t even show

Lyrics:

I don't need my phone,
You and I alone,
Baby, that's all that I want.
Out of control,
You and I alone,
Baby, that's all that I want.

I got my head, oh my head in the clouds,
They say it's not okay, but I'm not coming down.
I got my head, oh my head in the clouds,
That's just how the love's got me feeling now.

I'm up from Monday, all the way to Sunday,
24/7, showing you love,
24/7, you show me love.
I'm up from Monday, all the way to Sunday,
24/7, showing you love,
I'm more than just enough for ya.

Shining bright like the stars in the night,
Together we're diamonds,
Together we'll outshine the sun.
Put your body on me and collide,
Together we're diamonds.

I got my head, oh my head in the clouds,
They say it's not okay, but I'm not coming down.
I got my head, oh my head in the clouds,
That's just how the love's got me feeling now.

I'm up from Monday, all the way to Sunday,
24/7, showing you love,
24/7, you show me love.
I'm up from Monday, all the way to Sunday,
24/7, showing you love,
I'm more than just enough for ya.",1350,511289,34,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XcGfcx4YOVw/default.jpg,16:00:15,24/11/2023

Don't care what they say, or what games they play
Nothing is enough, 'til they handle love (Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight, I want you to stay, I want you tonight
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey (Hey)
Give me everything tonight (Hey)
Give me everything tonight (Hey)
Give me everything tonight (Hey)

Lyrics:
""Come and find me
I’m not far
I’ll be lost in the sound

Come and find me
You ain’t far
Baby, follow your heart

‘Cause tonight
I took a blue pill from a stranger
To keep my eyes wide shut in the night
I will forget you ain’t no angel
But I don’t care, I’m living my life

Tonight, tonight, my eyes wide shut
Tonight, tonight, my eyes wide shut
Tonight, tonight, my eyes wide shut
But I don’t care, I’m living my life

Come and find me
I’m not far
I’ll be lost in the sound

Come and find me
You ain’t far
Baby, follow your heart

‘Cause tonight
I took a blue pill from a stranger
To keep my eyes wide shut in the night
I will forget you ain’t no angel
But I don’t care, I’m living my life

Tonight, tonight, my eyes wide shut
Tonight, tonight, my eyes wide shut
Tonight, tonight, my eyes wide shut
Tonight

‘Cause tonight
I took a blue pill from a stranger
To keep my eyes wide shut in the night
I will forget you ain’t no angel
But I don’t care, I’m living my life

Tonight, tonight, my eyes wide shut

Tonight, tonight, my eyes wide shut

Lyrics

I've got fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul
And baby, you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason

If I didn't have you, there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down


Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down

I've got fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul
And baby, you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason

If I didn't have you, there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah

All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me

All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
